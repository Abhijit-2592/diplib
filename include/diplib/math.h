///
/// `"erf"` applies a mapping identical to that of the `dip::ErfClip` function with the lower range bound set to
/// `inMin` and the upper one set to `inMax`, and then scales the output to the requested range. Note that in this
/// case, the input is not hard-clipped to the range, but soft-clipped through the error function.
///
/// `"decade"` applies the following mapping to each sample:
/// ```cpp
///     dfloat decade = std::log10(( inMax - inMin ) / ( in - inMin + EPSILON ));
///     if( decade < parameter1 )
///        out = ( outMax - outMin ) * ( 1 + std::floor(decade) - decade ) + outMin;
///     else
///        out = 0;
/// ```
///
/// `"sigmoid"` applies the following mapping to each sample:
/// ```cpp
///     dfloat min = sigmoid( parameter1 * inMin + parameter2 );
///     dfloat max = sigmoid( parameter1 * inMax + parameter2 );
///     out = ( outMax - outMin ) / ( max - min ) * ( sigmoid( parameter1 * in + parameter2 ) - min ) + outMin;
/// ```
/// Here, the `sigmoid` function is `sigmoid(x) = x / ( 1 + std::abs(x) )`. `parameter1` represents the slope and
/// `parameter2` the point around which the sigmoid is centered.
