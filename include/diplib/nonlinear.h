/// specified. If it is a positive value, then the lowest (or highest) value found must be `threshold` lower (or
/// higher) than the central pixel, otherwise the central pixel is used.
///
/// Ties are solved by picking the value closest to the central pixel. Multiple control pixels with the same value
/// and at the same distance to the central pixel are solved arbitrarily (in the current implementation, the first
/// of these pixels encountered is used).

/// \brief The Kuwahara-Nagao operator, a non-linear edge-preserving smoothing filter.
///
/// For each pixel, shifts the filtering window such that the variance within the window is minimal, then
/// computes the average value as the output. The shift of the window is always such that the pixel under
/// consideration stays within the window.
///
/// In the two original papers describing the method (Kuwahara et al., 1980; Nagao and Matsuyama, 1979), a limited
/// number of sub-windows within the filtering window were examined (4 and 8, respectively). This function implements
/// a generalized version that allows as many different shifts are pixels are in the filtering window (Bakker et al.,
/// 1999).
///
/// As described by Bakker (2002), this operator produces artificial boundaries in flat regions. This is because,
/// due to noise, one position of the filtering window will have the lowest variance in its neighborhood, and therefore
/// that position will be selected for all output pixels in the neighborhood. The solution we implement here is
/// requiring that the variance at the minimum be lower than the variance when the window is not shifted. The parameter
/// `threshold` controls how much lower the minimum must be. If the neighborhood is uniform w.r.t. this threhsold
/// parameter, then the filtering window is not shifted.
///
/// The size and shape of the filter window is given by `kernel`, which you can define through a default
/// shape with corresponding sizes, or through a binary image. See `dip::Kernel`.
///
/// `boundaryCondition` indicates how the boundary should be expanded in each dimension. See `dip::BoundaryCondition`.

/// of `gradient`, and that only the direction of the vectors (or orientation) is used.
///
/// `gradmag` and `gradient` must be of the same floating-point type (i.e. they are either
/// `dip::DT_SFLOAT` or `dip::DT_DFLOAT`). `gradmag` must be scalar, and `gradient` must have as
/// many tensor elements as spatial dimensions. This function is implemented only for 1D, 2D and 3D
/// functions. In the 1D case, `gradient` is not used.
///
/// If `gradmag` is not forged, the magnitude (`dip::Norm`) of `gradient` is used instead.
///
/// `mask`, if forged, must be a binary scalar image. Only those pixels are evaluated that are set in `mask`.
///
/// All three input images (if forged) must have the same spatial dimensions.
///
/// `mode` can be "interpolate" or "round". The interpolating mode is only valid in 2D; the gradient magnitude
/// is interpolated to take into account all information present in the direction of the gradient. The rounding
/// mode rounds the angles to point to the nearest neighbor.
/// For higher-dimensional images, gradients are always rounded.
