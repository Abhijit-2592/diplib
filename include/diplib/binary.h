/// neighbors     | distance
/// --------------|----------
/// 4-connected   | 5
/// 8-connected   | 7
/// knight's move | 11
///
/// and in 3D as follows:

/// -----------------------|----------
/// 6-connected neighbors  | 4
/// 18-connected neighbors | 6
/// 26-connected neighbors | 7
/// knight's move          | 9
/// (2,1,1) neighbors      | 10
/// (2,2,1) neighbors      | 12
///
/// The `endPixelCondition` parameter determines what is considered an "end pixel" in the skeleton, and thus affects
/// how many branches are generated. It is one of the following strings:
///  - `"loose ends away"`: Loose ends are eaten away (nothing is considered an end point).
///  - `"natural"`: "natural" end pixel condition of this algorithm.
///  - `"one neighbor"`: Keep endpoint if it has one neighbor.
///  - `"two neighbors"`: Keep endpoint if it has two neighbors.
///  - `"three neighbors"`: Keep endpoint if it has three neighbors.
///
/// The `edgeCondition` parameter specifies whether the border of the image should be treated as object (`"object"`)
/// or as background (`"background"`).
///
/// **Limitations**
///  - This function is only implemented for 2D and 3D images.
///  - Pixels in a 2-pixel border around the edge are not processed. If this is an issue, consider adding 2 pixels
///    on each side of your image.
///  - Results in 3D are not optimal: `"loose ends away"`, `"one neighbor"` and `"three neighbors"` produce the
///    same results, and sometimes planes in the skeleton are not thinned to a single pixel thickness.
