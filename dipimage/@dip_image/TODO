These functions were overloaded in DIPimage 2.x, and haven't yet been overloaded in 3.0

pure MATLAB stuff:
   plot.m

   imarfun.m
   iterate.m

   find.m
   findcoord.m

   flipdim.m
   fliplr.m
   flipud.m
   rot90.m

new projections:
   all.m
   any.m
   unique.m

filtering:
   convhull.m
   rotate.m
   circshift.m

per-sample tests:
   isfinite.m
   isinf.m
   isnan.m

arithmetic:
   atan2.m (how do we implement this for 2-vector images?)
   hypot.m (how do we implement this for 2-vector images?)
   besselj.m (was this ever used?)

tensor arithmetic:
   curl.m
   divergence.m

   cross.m
   det.m
   dot.m
   eig.m
   eye.m
   inv.m
   norm.m
   pinv.m
   svd.m
   trace.m
