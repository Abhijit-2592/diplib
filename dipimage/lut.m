%LUT   Look-up Table (with interpolation)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%  image_out = lut(image_in,table)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%  table: an array with 1 or 3 columns (respectively produce a grey-value
%         image and an RGB image). MATLAB has many commands to create
%         colormaps (see 'help graph3d'). These should be used in this
%         way: lut(image,jet(256)*255)
%
% NOTES:
%  Indexing into the table starts at zero: pixel values should be
%  between 0 and LENGTH(TABLE)-1.
%
%  For integer images, the pixel values are table indices. For floating-
%  point images, the table-lookup is done with interpolation.
%
%  The output image has the same data type as TABLE.
%
%  TABLE can also be a 1D tensor image, where the output image will have the
%  same number of tensor elements, or a 2D scalar image of the same sizes
%  as that of the TABLE array input described above.
%
% DIPlib:
%  This function calls the DIPlib function dip::LookupTable::Apply.
