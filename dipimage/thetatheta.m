%THETATHETA   Creates an image with the theta component of spherical coordinates
%   THETATHETA(SIZE) returns an image of size SIZE with the value of the
%   theta component of the spherical coordinate as the pixel values. Theta is the
%   angle to the z-axis. SIZE must have 3 components.
%
%   THETATHETA(IMG) is the same as THETATHETA(SIZE(IMG)).
%
%   THETATHETA(...,ORIGIN) allows specifying where the origin is:
%    - 'left':        The pixel to the left of the true center.
%    - 'right':       The pixel to the right of the true center (default).
%    - 'true':        The true center, between pixels if required.
%    - 'corner':      The pixel on the upper left corner (indexed at (0,0)).
%    - 'frequency':   Uses frequency domain coordinates, in the range [-0.5,0.5),
%                     corresponds to coordinate system used by FT.
%   Note that the first three are identical if the size is odd.
%
%   THETATHETA(...,ORIGIN,OPTIONS) further specifies one or both of these options:
%    - 'radial':      When 'frequency' is selected as the origin, causes it to
%                     use radial frequencies instead, making the range [-pi,pi).
%    - 'math':        Let the Y coordinate increase upwards instead of downwards.
%   To provide both options, join the strings in a cell array
%
%  It is possible to set ORIGIN to 'radfreq', which combines 'frequency' with
%  'radial'.
%
%  Prepending an 'm' to any option for ORIGIN is equivalent to setting the
%  'math' option. That is, THETATHETA(...,'mleft') is equivalent to
%  THETATHETA(...,'left','math').
